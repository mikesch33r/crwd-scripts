# Directions:
# Be sure that you have an API in the Parent CID with ML Exclusions: Read & Write permissions & Flight Control: Read permission.
# Run the script and add the parameters required when prompted ($ClientID, $ClientSecret, $MLEcid, and $MLEvalue)
    # Note that the $MLEcid is the child CID that already has the ML Exclusion you'd like to duplicate
    # Note that the $MLEvalue is the exact path of the ML Exclusion you'd like to duplicate

#Requires -Version 5.1
